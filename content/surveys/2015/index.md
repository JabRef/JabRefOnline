# Overview of the 2015 JabRef survey

## Introduction

In November 2015, the community was asked to fill a survey about JabRef usages and potential developments
About 400 responses were collected.
This page presents an overview of the results.
A detailed analysis is provided at [Analysis](./analysis).

## Current use of JabRef

- JabRef is the primary bibliographic software of responders. If not, Zotero, a plain text editor and Mendeley are the most popular.
- JafRef is mostly used in relation with TeX-world softwares.
- English is the primary language for the user interface.
- Stability of the software is a key requirement.
- JabRef should be compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac.
- While hand edition of BibTeX files is common, feature improvements will reduce this practice.
- While the default key pattern is ok, the ability to alter it is a required feature.
- Both types of special characters (i.e. Ã¼ and \"{u}) need to be supported.
- UTF-8 is widely-used for encoding the databases, so available choices of encoding could be simplified.
- Add-ons should be better advertised (import filters, export filters, plugins, journal abbreviation lists, external fetchers and external tools).

## Improvements should mainly target:

- Importation of entry
- The graphic user interface
- Entry editing

## New features?

The most desirable features are at the top of the graph, the least desirable at the bottom.
