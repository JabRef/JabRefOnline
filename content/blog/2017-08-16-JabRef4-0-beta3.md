The transition to the new GUI technology JavaFX is reaching a milestone where most of the entry editor is already migrated.
This beta3 release should encourage you to test the new user interface, especially the new entry editor, as we feel that it can be released soon.

Since the last [beta2 release](http://blog.jabref.org/2017/07/19/JabRef4-0-beta2) we focused mainly on the interplay of the new entry editor with the rest of JabRef, especially the main table.
We fixed several issues concerning keyboard shortcuts, special actions like UNDO-REDO and the overall stability of the program.

Most problems should be resolved by now, and we need your feedback for being confident that we can release JabRef 4.0. Please report any bugs and inconveniences either [at the GitHub bug tracker](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/new) or [at the discussion forum](http://discourse.jabref.org). Thank you!
