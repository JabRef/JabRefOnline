Great news! JabRef got accepted as an open source organization for this year's [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
<!--more-->
The goal of this annual program is to give university students and now in 2022, for the first time, other people the opportunity to learn about and get involved in open source development.
People will work three months on a project for an open source organization and are mentored by members of the project.
It is a great honor for JabRef to be part of this program for the third time.

From April 4, 2022 to April 19, 2022 [people can apply](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/jabref-ev) for participation in the GSoC.
Interested people are [invited to have a look at our list of possible project ideas](http://www.jabref.org/GSoC2022.html) or suggest their own projects.
We are looking forward to introducing people to the open source community and provide guidance while they work on a real world open source project.

In the meantime, we continue to work on fixing bugs and adding new features.

Stay tuned for further updates!
