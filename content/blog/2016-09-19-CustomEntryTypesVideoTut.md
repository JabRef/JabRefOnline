BibTeX and BibLaTeX allow users to define their own entry types and fields.
As a leading reference management software using Bib(La)TeX format natively,
JabRef includes this capability.

In JabRef, you can [customize entry types](http://help.jabref.org/en/CustomEntriesHelp) in just a few clicks.
A tutorial by the [Khmer TeX Users Group](https://khtug.blogspot.de/) illustrates this feature.
