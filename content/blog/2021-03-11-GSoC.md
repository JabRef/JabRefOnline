Great news! JabRef got accepted as an open source organization for this year's [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
The goal of this annual program is to give university students opportunity to learn about and get involved in open source development.
Students will work three months on a project for an open source organization and are mentored by members of the project.
It is a great honor for JabRef to be part of this program for the second time.

From March, 29 until April 13, 2021, [students can apply](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5278426606338048/) for participation in the GSoC.
Interested students are [invited to have a look at our list of possible project ideas](http://www.jabref.org/GSoC2021.html) or suggest their own projects.
We are looking forward to introducing students to the open source community and provide guidance while they work on a real world open source project during their summer break from university.

In the meantime, we continue to work hard on the upcoming 5.3 version.

Stay tuned for further updates!
