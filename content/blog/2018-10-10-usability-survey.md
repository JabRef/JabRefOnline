As we have mentioned in the [previous post](https://blog.jabref.org/#october-02-2018-%E2%80%93-hacktoberfest-and-jabref-5-0-development), the development of JabRef 5.0 is underway.
Since this will bring substantial changes to the user interface, we want to make sure that we consider your workflow in JabRef.
Therefore, we need to learn how you, the users, use JabRef!

For this we are supported by Martin Simon, a student of Ergonomics - Human Factors Engineering at the Technical University of Munich, who has developed a short questionnaire on the feature usage of JabRef.
This study is conducted within the scope of Martin's Master's Thesis in collaboration with the JabRef Development Team.
It shall provide insights to the current usage of JabRef that should guide the future development of the user interface.
Of course, we will also publish the aggregated results here in the blog.
