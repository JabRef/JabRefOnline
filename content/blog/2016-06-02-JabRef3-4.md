We are pleased to announce the release of JabRef version 3.4!

The new version can be downloaded as of now from [FossHub](http://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html), the official JabRef download site.

The main focus of this release is improving the grouping functionality of JabRef with various bug fixes and new features:

- Group information is now directly stored in the BibEntry - and no longer at the end of the `bib` file
- Group view is immediately updated after adding an entry to a group
- Dragging an entry to a group preserves scrolling
- Entries retain their groupmembership when undoing their cut/deletion
- The group tree now uses the whole available space in the left sidebar

Some other selected new features and improvements are:

- You can directly paste a DOI into the main table and JabRef tries to create the matching entry
  - _Did you know: This also works with complete BibTeX entries you have in your clipboard!_
- The merge entries dialog now shows all text and colored differences between the fields
- Added support for several Biblatex-fields through drop-down lists with valid alternatives
- DOI and normal web links are now distinguished with different icons in the main table

JabRef 3.4 also includes more than 30 bug fixes and the removal of a few features (mostly outdated).
Details are listed on [GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v3.4/CHANGELOG.md).
