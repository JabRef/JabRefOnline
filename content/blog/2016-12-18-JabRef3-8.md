After one month of hard work, we released the next version of JabRef.
The new version 3.8 can be downloaded from [FossHub](https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html).
Version 3.8 contains more than 15 bug fixes and 17 changes and improvements.

The most notable new aspects are:

- Bibliographic information from web resources can now be used to complete existing entries.
  This functionality can be accessed via a new button in the entry editor.
- Improved [fetching of BibTeX data using the ISBN number](http://help.jabref.org/en/ISBNtoBibTeX).
- We reworked the [customized entry types](https://help.jabref.org/en/CustomEntryTypes) and they should now be more usable.
  - Upon the first start of JabRef 3.8 old entry type customizations will be converted to custom types for the set default database mode.
- You can now press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy the formatted preview of multiple entries.
  This especially helps when sending references or working together on Google Docs.
- We worked on the [shared SQL database](https://help.jabref.org/en/SQLDatabase) feature and especially fixed an issue at the synchronization of metadata.
- Files can now be moved to subfolders named by a custom format pattern, e.g., based on `entrytype`.
- Fetching from [dblp](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/) works again.

An overview of all new features and fixes can be found as usual in the [Changelog at GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v3.8/CHANGELOG.md).
