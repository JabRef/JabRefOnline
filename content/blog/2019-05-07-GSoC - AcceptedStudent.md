Great news! In the last post we announced that JabRef got accepted as an open source organization for this year's [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
Now we are happy to tell that we have accepted a student, David Méndez, who will be improving JabRef this summer.

Until August he will be working on a project on establishing a tighter interplay between JabRef and your research papers.
We are looking forward to start working with him. He will be mentored throughout the project by three of our developers.

We nonetheless would like to thank all other students as well who applied for GSoC and chose JabRef as organization they wanted to work with.
This year is the first time JabRef is participating in GSoC and we were overwhelmed by the interest in JabRef.
It was a tough choice having to reject so many developers who are motivated to contribute to scientific free and open source software!

Of course, all other interested persons are invited as well to contribute! The list of potential projects can be found here: [http://www.jabref.org/GSoC2019.html](http://www.jabref.org/GSoC2019.html)

Stay tuned for further updates!
