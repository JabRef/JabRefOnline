Great news! JabRef got accepted as an open source organization for this year's [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
The goal of this annual program is to give university students oppurtunity to learn about and get involved in open source development.
Students will work three months on a project for an open source organization and are mentored by members of the project.
It is a great honor for JabRef to be part of this program for the first time (as one of 27 organizations participating in GSoC this year for the first time)!

Until April 9, 2019 [students can apply](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6085209989054464/) for participation in the GSoC.
Interested students are [invited to have a look at our list of possible project ideas](http://www.jabref.org/GSoC2019.html) or suggest their own projects.
We are looking forward to introduce students to the open source community and provide guidance while they work on a real world open source project during their summer break from university.

In the meantime, we continue to work hard on finishing the conversion to the new GUI technology JavaFX with the goal to streamline the user experience.
The majority of dialogs is already reworked, so a first alpha version of version 5.0 is around the corner.

Stay tuned for further updates!
