After almost three month of fixing bugs and improving some features we just released the next version of JabRef.

The new version 3.7 can be downloaded as of now from [FossHub](http://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html) or at [GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/releases/tag/v3.7).

Version 3.7 contains 56 bug fixes and more than 45 changes and improvements.

The most notable new aspects are:

- We again **improved the search interface**: Despite having a specific search bar for each open database, there is a now a global search bar.
  - It is now possible to search either in the currently open, or all opened files (use _"globe"_ icon to switch)
  - The window showing the global results has been improved (e.g., it now shows the database for each search hit)
- Due to changes at the side of **Medline/Pubmed** the fetcher stopped working in all previous versions. This is fixed in 3.7.
- Improved **integrity checks and hints**:
  - Using the short cut <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>F8</kbd> opens the integrity check dialog
  - improved and added some checks (e.g., `ISBN`, `journaltitle`, `bibtexkey`)
  - give format hints in the entry editor (grayed out date and author format)
- The workflow to create new entries by IDs has been optimized: Creating a new entry based on DOI/ISBN/Medline/ADS information is no longer accessible using the Web Search feature, but directly integrated in the "new entry" dialog
- Improved multi display support
- Previews can now use citationstyles from [citationstyles.org](http://citationstyles.org/) (accessible using `Options`-> `Preferences`-> `Entry preview`)

An overview of all new features and fixes can be found as usual in the [Changelog at GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v3.7/CHANGELOG.md).
