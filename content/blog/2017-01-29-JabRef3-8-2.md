As the new year is now almost one month old it's time to replace the "Christmas Edition" of JabRef with a normal release. Thus: We have just released version 3.8.2!

The new version 3.8.2 can be downloaded as of now from [FossHub](http://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html) or at [GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/releases/tag/v3.8.2).

Apart from the switch to standard colors version 3.8.2 contains mainly bug fixes.

The most important fixes are:

- A problem during "find unlinked files" which might have frozen JabRef has been fixed
- dynamic, RegEx-based groups can be edited again
- non-ISO timestamps do no longer prevent the opening of the entry editor
- Collapse and expand all buttons in the group assignment dialog no longer lead to a crash of JabRef.

An overview of all new features and fixes can be found as usual in the [Changelog at GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v3.8.2/CHANGELOG.md).

_A note to all Mac OS X users: There might be problems if you don't have Java 8 installed on your machine.
Moreover, you might be required to use `Cmd-MouseClick` to open the installer to be able to ignore a security warning.
For more information [checkout the Mac OSX FAQs](https://help.jabref.org/en/FAQosx)._

For questions about the functioning or suggestions for improvements please use [the discussion forum](http://discourse.jabref.org).
In case you have trouble, report bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues).

## JabCon 2017

As in the last year we'll host a small conference - or meet-up - called JabCon.

From Wednesday, February 15, 2017 (13:00) to Friday, February 17, 2017 (12:00) the core developers and users of JabRef will meet in Lugano (Switzerland) to discuss the future directions of JabRef.
The conference is intended for both, users and developers of JabRef, as we want to strengthen the network between users, between users and developers, and between the developers. The result of the conference should be new ideas for JabRef, fixed bugs, and newly implemented features.

The sessions are subdivided into talks, workshops, and hacking sessions.

If you are interested in participating [check out the details and the schedule on the JabCon page here](http://jabcon.jabref.org/).

If you can't make it to Lugano, you could also join use via Skype or propose your ideas [at the discussion forum](http://discourse.jabref.org)!

We would also be pleased if you would help us to reduce our expenses [by supporting us through donations](https://www.jabref.org/#donations).

See you in Lugano!
