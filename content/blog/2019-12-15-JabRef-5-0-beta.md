We are proud to announce the release of the first beta of JabRef 5.0 just in time for Christmas! ðŸš€ ðŸŽ„

Since the [alpha release](http://blog.jabref.org/#august-27-2019-%E2%80%93-jabcon-2019-jabref-5-0-alpha-release) of Jabref 5.0 we continued fixing bugs and addressed many usability issues.

In total, more than 40 major bugs have been fixed so that JabRef is now more stable and performs better than the previously released alpha.
As usually, the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/v5.0-beta/CHANGELOG.md) contains a detailed list of all changes.

Our Linux users will surely be happy that we finally offer deb and rpm packages as well as a portable edition, and that we now completly support the X11 primary selection (typically used by the middle mouse key).

After feedback on the new integrated preview next to the entry editor on the alpha version, we added an an option to show the preview as an extra tab in the entry editor (instead of in a split view).

One major feature of the upcoming 5.0 release is the "Dark Theme" which has been improved since the alpha 5.0. The "Dark Theme" can be enabled in the preferences under the tab "Appearance".

We also would like to thank all of our various contributors, translators, testers and donors! This helps us a lot!

## Installation

With the release of the 5.0-beta we switched to a new native Java build system which allows us to bundle a custom Java runtime together with JabRef.
This means that problems with other installed or outdated java versions on the system are a problem of the past. This also means it's no longer possible to start JabRef directly from the jar.
For the installation we now offer self-containing `.deb` and `.rpm` files for Linux users and in addtion to the usual installer for Windows.
We also offer a portable zip version of JabRef which also includes all necessary files to run JabRef.
No installed Java version required.

## Known Issues

Currently the following major issues are known:
