We are proud to announce the release of the next milestone of JabRef, this time JabRef 5.6. As always, this release comes with several bug fixes and also some new features.

## Notable Changes and New Features

This release comes with several new fetchers for the websearch ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), [SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) and [Directory of Open Access Books](https://doabooks.org/)). Since OttoBib ceased service, we also switched to [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/) to fetch citations by ISBN. We also enabled the user to customize their access key for some fetchers if they have privileged access to certain web-portals/databases.

Since our last publicly announced release we have made a lot of changes behind the scene. We have, for instance, completely switched text encoding to Unicode, more and more preferences have effect without the need to restart JabRef and we completely revised the Open-/LibreOffice connection. Feedback on this is very welcome. Of course, we also fixed many other bugs and updated some external dependencies. As a result JabRef should feel a bit faster and consume less system memory for most tasks as compared to version 5.5. We are very happy about that!

A notable change for users (with large databases) is the need to recreate the search index. Switching back and forth JabRef versions and meanwhile adding PDFs also requires rebuilding the index now and then. Having realized indexing can take a long time for huge libraries, a preference option was added to disable it entirely.

For a complete list of all our changes, take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

**You can get JabRef for free from [FOSShub](https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html).**
