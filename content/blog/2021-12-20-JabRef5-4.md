We are proud to announce the release of the next milestone of JabRef, this time JabRef 5.4, just in time for the holidays!

<!--more-->

It's been roughly half a year since the previous release of 5.3, and we are happy to announce that despite the still ongoing Covid-19 waves we were all fortunately able to continue working on JabRef.

## Notable Changes and New Features

Thanks to this year's Google Summer of Code, JabRef now has a PDF-fulltext search and improved metadata support. This allows you to search across libraries and linked files.
Search results across several libraries can now also be shown again in a new window. It's also possible to keep the search string when switching between libraries.
Another major improvement is the metadata extraction and writing for PDFs. When generating an entry from a PDF, JabRef now checks different sources and provides an improved merge dialog to combine the extracted metadata.

Further work focused on improving the user experience in the GUI. For example, we added an icon picker to the Groups dialog to easily search for a suitable group icon.
We also added the possibility to search all available citation styles together with a sample preview.

Additionally to these, we also fixed many bugs.
For a complete list of all our changes, take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) since our last official release!

**You can get it from [FOSShub](https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html).**

In case you notice any bugs or problems, please check our [bug tracker](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues) and consider submitting a new bug report if nobody else has been reporting the failure before.

## Special Thanks

The [JabRef Maintainers](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/MAINTAINERS) would like to give special thanks to all new and old contributors. We are delighted to see so many new contributors opening pull requests and making translations or simply answering questions in our [support forum](https://discourse.jabref.org/). The Release 5.4 now also includes Korean (ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥) as a new language.
As we all work on JabRef in our free time, we feel honored that people share our enthusiasm for free software and work together to make research easier.

A big thanks also to all our donators!

We also want to thank all universities [including JabRef in their academic teaching](https://devdocs.jabref.org/teaching).

Finally, we want to thank all the users who are constantly testing the latest snapshots and giving feedback!

The JabRef Maintainers wish everyone Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year! üéâüçæüéÜ Stay safe everyone!
