We are proud to announce the release of the next milestone of JabRef, and we are releasing JabRef 5.2. Just in time for the holidays!
We are also happy to announce that [Domninik Voigt](https://github.com/DominikVoigt), who worked on JabRef as part of his Bachelor thesis now joined the ranks of core developers!

## Notable Changes and New Features

After the release of the previous major milestone 5.1 we focused on bug fixes and some new features!

This release brings some improvements and bug fixes for users who are using shared SQL databases for collaborative work and those that use LibreOffice.
For users switching from EndNote to JabRef, we have improved the EndNote importer.
We also fixed a bug where possible errors during the import were not shown to the user.
In addition, we now added a YAML exporter to export your library in the YAML format.

Our new developer implemented a feature for systematic literature search in JabRef. The feature still needs some work until it's usable for non-technical users. Therefore, it's not yet enabled in JabRef.

Additionally, we also tweaked the user interface. In 5.0 we introduced the option to have a “Dark Theme” and with this release it is now possible to create your own theme by [adjusting the CSS](https://docs.jabref.org/advanced/custom-themes).
The preferences dialog and some menu items were adjusted for consistency. For those who missed our Emacs/bash keybindings, we are happy to tell you that we reimplemented this feature. The feature can now be configured as part of the "Manage keybindings" dialog.

The [JabRef Browser extension](https://docs.jabref.org/collect/jabref-browser-extension) is now also compatible with the new version of Microsoft Edge and available for all major browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Vivaldi)

[And many more! In total, there are again many changes](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) since our last official release!
