ðŸ“… ðŸŽƒ October is here and that means that it's time for 2019's edition of **Hacktoberfest**!

Since three years, the JabRef developers aim for increasing the code quality of JabRef.
Having pull requests reviewed by at least two other developers, the feedback on the code is of high quality.
The benefit for the contributor is that their **Java coding skills are enhanced**:
Not only the features are evaluated, but also the architecture of the code and the code style.
Looking back, after going through that feedback, all former contributors said that they learned much during contributing to JabRef.

After a [successful participation in Google's Summer of Code 2019](https://blog.jabref.org/2019/08/06/GSoC-LatexCitationsTab/) and giving feedback on many pull requests, we decided to take part in Hacktoberfest 2019.

Check out our [Hacktoberfest 2919 Website](http://www.jabref.org/hacktoberfest/2019.html) for details and rules!

Always remember `Hacktoberfest value #2`: **Quantity is fun, quality is key**
