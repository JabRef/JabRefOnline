TODO:
- Decide if "editor" should be added (it is supported by biblatex). What's the purpose, and does it refer to an editor of the article or an editor of the journal?
- Decide if "version" should be added (it is supported by biblatex, but the definition says "The revision number of a piece of software, a manual, etc." which is not very specific).
