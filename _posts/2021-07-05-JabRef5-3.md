We are proud to announce the release of the next milestone of JabRef, this time JabRef 5.3!
It's been roughly half a year since the previous release of 5.2, and we are happy to announce that despite Covid-19 we were all fortunately able to continue working on JabRef.
We are also happy to have two students working as part of Google Summer of Code on some cool new features.

## Notable Changes and New Features

The most notable new feature is the experimental implementation of a **systematic literature review (SLR)** functionality, one of our maintainers worked on for his bachelor thesis.
Another major improvement is the "Find unlinked files" dialog. We improved the import performance of many files and also added options to filter the shown files by their modification date. A big thanks to the student team that worked on this feature.
Additionally, we also simplified the ["Select entry type" dialog](https://docs.jabref.org/collect/add-entry-manually) to show some useful recommendations.
Despite this new feature, we also fixed many bugs. Some of them were related to import/export and the handling of linked files.
For a complete list of all our changes, take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) since our last official release!

In case you notice any bugs or problems, please check our [bug tracker](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues) and consider submitting a new bug report if nobody else has been reporting the failure before.

## Special Thanks

The [JabRef Maintainers](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/MAINTAINERS) would like to give special thanks to all new and old contributors. We are delighted to see so many new contributors opening pull requests and making translations. As we all work on JabRef in our free time, we feel honored that people share our enthusiasm for free software and work together to make research easier. Some big news about how to be part of this project will follow soon.

We also want to thank all universities [including JabRef in their academic teaching](https://devdocs.jabref.org/teaching).

Finally, we want to thank all the users who are constantly testing the latest snapshots and giving feedback!
We also hope that our users are all able to receive a vaccination (or two 💉💉) against Covid-19!
