After more than four months of hard work and following our work on the JabCon, we are proud to release JabRef 4.2!

We worked to fix a lot of freezes and performance issues, for example when searching or opening the entry editor.
Some other performance improvements are related to [journal abbreviations](https://help.jabref.org/en/JournalAbbreviations).

Of course, we also implemented some cool new features, for example the [PDF XMP](https://help.jabref.org/en/XMP) Import/Export in [DublinCore](http://dublincore.org/) format.
The DublinCore format is now the only metadata format which JabRef supports in PDFs.
The previously used custom format was dropped in favor of the DublinCore format.

Additionally, based on a feature request in our forum, JabRef is now able to import files in Endnote XML format.
Furthermore, we improved the export of the `address`  and `location` fields to the corresponding MS Office XML fields.
If the address field does not contain a comma, it is treated as single value and exported to the field city. [#1750, comment](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1750#issuecomment-357539167) For more details refer to the [field mapping help page](http://help.jabref.org/en/MsOfficeBibFieldMapping)

To avoid confusion for JabRef newcomers, we renamed the `Review` tab in the entry editor to `Comments`.
Existing entries having a `Review` field will be automatically migrated to the new field `Comments`.

Despite fixing some existing fetchers, e.g., the IEEE fetcher now uses the securely encrypted `https`, we implemented support for the [oaDOI](https://oadoi.org/) fetcher.
JabRef is now able to download full text articles for more than 90 million open-access articles.
Also, we fixed and extended the RIS import functionality to cover more fields.

Unfortunately, JabRef binaries are still not digitally signed.
We are in the process of obtaining a new code signing certificate from Comodo.
In the meantime, please check the [installations instructions](https://help.jabref.org/en/#faq) for your Operating System (especially [MacOs](https://help.jabref.org/en/FAQosx)), in case JabRef cannot be started.

Here is an excerpt of our [full changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#42---2018-04-26).

- We improved file saving so that hard links are now preserved when a save is performed [#2633](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2633)

## Bug Fixes

- We fixed an issue where odd linked files could not be selected in the entry editor. [#3639](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3639)

## Removed
