[Citavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citavi) is the premier reference management software for Windows made in Switzerland.
Its strong support for Microsoft Word and PDF annotations makes them a strong counterpart of JabRef.

Having collected much [donations](http://donations.jabref.org/), the JabRef project was able to buy [Swiss Academic Software GmbH](https://www.citavi.com/de/swiss-academic-software.html).
We have developed a direct bridge from JabRef to Citavi, which offers an outstanding experience when using JabRef together with Microsoft Word.
Citavi will still be sold as a separate product.
However, all JabRef users who donated more than 50€ will be able to enable the Citavi bridge for free in the new release, being available from April 1st.
