# [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) with [Nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org/)

- `+` Single file components
- `+` Easier to start with
- `+` Better documentation
- `+` Good compromise of minimalist library (react) vs full-fledged platform (angular)
- `+` Not based on JSX (don't like the syntax)
- `-` Have to learn syntax like`v-if` etc
- `-` React has larger ecosystem
- `-` React has better typescript support (but better TS support is coming with Vue 3)

# Considered Alternatives

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
