# NodeJS with Express.js

- `+` Full js stack: common language makes it easier to work on, code reuse, most-used programming language 
- `-` Harder to integrate with ML models (although there is https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/01/run-tensorflow-savedmodel-in-nodejs-directly-without-conversion.html and https://gist.github.com/zcaceres/4cc1afb1d3b7550aeffec898967bd56c)
- `-` Not best for computation-heavy back end processes (but these should be rare for us)

# Considered alternatives
- Rust
- Django or Flask (better ML integration)
